INHERITANCE

Allows to inherit properties from another class -> Code reusability and establishing relationship between classes(Association)

Single Inheritance = One parent and one child

Multilevel Inheritance = Class inherits from another class, which in turn inherits from another class

Hierarchical Inheritance = Multiple classes inherit from a single class

Multiple Inheritance = Achieved through interfaces, as classes cannot extend more than 1 class

Hybrid Inheritance = Multiple Inheritance + Hierarchical Inheritance
