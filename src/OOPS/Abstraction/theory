ABSTRACTION:

Hides complex implementations, only shows necessary information
Simplifies code interaction and reduces complexity
For example:
Driving a car -> Don’t want to know how engine or internal system working
SQL query -> Database Interface with methods ‘connect’ and ‘query’, hiding details of SQL and NoSQL operations

2 ways to implement abstraction: abstract classes(50%) and interfaces(100%)
Abstract Classes-
Abstract class is a superclass that cannot be instantiated. To create new object, need to instantiate one of its child classes.
It can have both abstract(contains only method signatures) and concrete methods(declare the method body as well).

Interfaces-
100% abstractions -> Can have final, static, public fields and abstract methods only. Class can implement any number of interfaces with ‘implements’ keyword
