MULTITHREADING

It allows multiple threads (single unit of process) to run concurrently, providing better CPU utilization.

Provides in-built support -> mainly via 2 interfaces:
1. Thread class
2. Runnable Interface

1.	Thread class:
	•	Java provides the Thread class, which you can extend to create a new thread. By overriding the run() method, you can define the behavior of the thread.

2.	Runnable interface:
	•	The Runnable interface defines a single method, run(), which is used to implement a thread’s task.
	    The advantage is that a class can implement Runnable without extending the Thread class, allowing it to extend another class if needed (Java supports single inheritance).
